# Anji---A-Text-Adventure-Game
This is my first attempt at creating a text adventure game. 
This is game is based on an Indian fantasy movie with the same name. 
It is a simple work that includes basic python essentials like: 
  Strings and String Manipulation , 
  User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables),
  User Input and Input Handling, 
  Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else), 
  Loops (for/while), 
  Controlling for Errors (try/except). 
It has 3 rounds.
